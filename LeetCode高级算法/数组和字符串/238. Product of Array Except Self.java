/*
Given numbers [2, 3, 4, 5], regarding the third number 4, the product of array except 4 is 2*3*5 which consists of two parts: left 2*3 and right 5. The product is left*right. We can get lefts and rights:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:            2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5      
Let’s fill the empty with 1:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:       1    2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5     1
We can calculate lefts and rights in 2 loops. The time complexity is O(n).

We store lefts in result array. If we allocate a new array for rights. The space complexity is O(n). To make it O(1), we just need to store it in a variable which is right in @lycjava3’s code.

    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        // Calculate lefts and store in res.
        res[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            res[i] = res[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        // Calculate rights and the product from the end of the array.
        int right = 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            res[i] *= right;
            right *= nums[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
